            <p>Deer antlers are one of the fastest growing tissues in the world. A buck's antlers are made of bone and
                can grow over more than an inch a day.During the antler growth period, so much calcium and phosphorous
                is required that the buck will go through a temporary form of osteoperosis because minerals from the
                animal's bones are used to form its antlers. </p>
