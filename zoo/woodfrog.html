            <p>Wood frogs found in Alaska hibernate during 7 to 8 months of the year and essentially freeze during this
                time. Its liver secretes a syrupy substance that serves as a type of antifreeze to protect its cells.
                The water in between the cells freezes. During this hibernation period it stops breathing and its heart
                stops beating. Once springtime returns the wood frog thaws out.</p>
