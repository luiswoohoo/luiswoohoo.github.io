        <p>The axolotl is a type of salamander found in Lake Xochimilco in Mexico. It has the amazing ability to
            regenerate any part of its body that gets damaged or amputated. Besides regenerating limbs it can also
            regenerate organs like its heart and even parts of its brain. And it does so without leaving scar
            tissue.</p>
