        <p>When the arctic ground squirrel hibernates its body temperature drops to 26.8 degrees Fahrenheit. During
            hibernation, every two or three weeks, the arctic ground squirrel will shiver itself back to its normal
            body temperature of 97.5 degrees Fahrenheit and won't get cold again for another 12 to 15 hours. This allows
            the squirrel's brain to survive without getting damaged. When the squirrel emerges from hibernation its
            brain returns to normal within about two hours. Some research suggests that its brain works even better
            after hibernation.</p>
