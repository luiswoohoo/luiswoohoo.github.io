            <p>When the arctic ground squirrel hibernates its body temperature drops to 26.8 degrees Fahrenheit. During
                hibernation, every two or three weeks, the arctic ground squirrel will shiver itself back to its normal
                body
                temperature of 97.5 degrees Fahrenheit and won't get cold again for another 12 to 15 hours. This allows
                the
                squirrel's brain to survive without getting damaged. When the squirrel emerges from hibernation its
                brain
                returns to normal within about two hours. Some research suggests that its brain works even better after
                hibernation.</p>
